# Backend Projects – Python

Welcome to my backend development repository! This collection gathers both **completed** and **in-progress** Python projects I've created during my learning journey. It’s a mix of exercises, challenges, and real-world applications built with tools like Flask and Django.

This repo is part of my portfolio and personal archive as I continue improving my backend development skills.
